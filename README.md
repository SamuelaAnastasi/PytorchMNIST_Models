# PytorchMNIST_Models
PrivateAI challenge from Facebook and Udacity - Experimenting with Deep Learning Models for MNIST dataset with Pytorch. Played with different Params, Hyperparams and Model Architecture to see the correlation with accuracy and printed statistics. Used Early Stopping and Dropouts techniques to avoid overfitting, with train/validation/test sets.
